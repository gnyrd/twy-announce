## Quick Start

**Choose your approach:**
- 💻 **Local** (faster for testing) → See [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)


```bash
# 1. Build
make build

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# 3. Authenticate
make auth

# 4. Find group ID
make list-groups
# Add group ID to .env

# 5. Test
make test
```

### Local Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Authenticate
npm run auth

# 4. Find group ID
npm run list-groups

# 5. Test
npm run test
```

## Runtime / Production Overview

- Automatic class-reminder emails are handled by a **Python pipeline** run from cron on a Hetzner host.
- Cron calls `scripts/run_class_email_reminders.sh`, which loads `.env` and runs `scripts/send_class_email_reminders.py`.
- The Node-based WhatsApp scripts (`whatsapp_bot.js`, `list_groups.js`, etc.) now serve as an **optional toolbox** for manual WhatsApp tests and one-off posts.
- For exact cron examples and toolbox commands, see [WARP.md](WARP.md).

## Current Status

🟡 **Development Phase** - WhatsApp proof of concept in progress

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for detailed current state.

---

## Project Goals

1. ✅ **Automate class announcements** - No more manual posting every day
2. ✅ **Post day-before reminders** - Give people time to prepare
3. ✅ **Include class links** - Fetch from Marvelous platform automatically
4. ✅ **Configurable timing** - Mid-afternoon Mountain Time (configurable)

---

## How It Works (When Complete)

1. **Daily scheduler** runs at configured time
2. **Google Drive parser** checks for next day's events
3. **Marvelous integration** fetches class links
4. **Message generator** creates post from template
5. **WhatsApp automation** posts to group
